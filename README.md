Welcome to the Unravel Workshop repository! This is an exclusive platform where Unravel publishes cutting-edge tech solutions, interesting examples, and offers a deep-dive into the technology world. Here, we showcase our commitment to innovation, aesthetics, and excellence in software development.

## Getting Started

The Unravel Workshop is organized as a monorepo containing multiple applications. Each application is a standalone example of our elite tech solutions, crafted with attention to detail and the highest standards of quality and performance.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest stable version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

To get started with the Unravel Workshop, you need to perform installations at both the project level and the individual app level.

1. **Project-Level Installation:**
